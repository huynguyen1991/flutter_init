# Generated Output Reference

This guide provides an accurate breakdown of the file and folder structure produced by FlutterInit.

## Application Structure

FlutterInit follows a "src-first" encapsulation model. All internal logic, implementation details, and features live inside `lib/src/` to separate private implementation from public API exports.

## Key File Breakdown

- **`lib/main.dart`**: The designated root of your executable. It handles initial asynchronous tasks (e.g., Environment loading, Native Splash preservation, Localization binding) before invoking the `runApp()` method.
- **`lib/src/app.dart`**: Defines your root visual wrapper. It is responsible for injecting global state providers, setting up the Router delegate, and applying system-wide UI wrappers like Skeletonization or Session monitoring.
- **`lib/src/shared/`**: Contains components that are truly global.
  - **`widgets/`**: Reusable standalone UI components.
  - **`wrappers/`**: Structural widgets that provide context (e.g., `ScreenUtilWrapper`).
  - **`hooks/`**: Custom Flutter Hooks (enabled if `usesFlutterHooks` is true).
- **`lib/src/imports/`**: Houses "Barrel Files" that act as singular entry points for entire modules.
  - `imports.dart`: The primary import you'll use in feature files.
  - `core_imports.dart`: Internal project exports and Flutter SDK.
  - `packages_imports.dart`: Selective exports of third-party dependencies.
- **`lib/src/theme/`**: Centralizes your design tokens. Instead of hardcoding values, you reference `AppSpacing`, `AppBorders`, and `AppColors` derived from here.

## Adaptive Architectures

While the `lib/src/` core remains consistent for internal tools, your selected **Architecture** flag determines how your business logic and UI are organized:

- **Feature-First / Clean**: Logic is segregated into `lib/src/features/` with sub-folders for `auth`, `home`, and domain-specific entities.
- **MVC / MVVM**: Global `lib/src/controllers/`, `lib/src/models/`, and `lib/src/views/` (or `ui/`) directories are created to house logic according to the selected pattern.
- **Layer-First**: Divides implementation into `lib/src/data/`, `lib/src/domain/`, and `lib/src/presentation/` layers.

## Modifying the Codebase

- **Green Light (Edit Freely)**: Everything inside `lib/src/features` (or your architecture's UI folder). This is where you build your application's unique value.
- **Yellow Light (Edit with Care)**: `lib/src/theme/`. These define your brand's look and feel, but changing them will affect the entire application UI immediately.
- **Red Light (Avoid Editing)**: `lib/src/imports/`. These are automatically managed by the generator. Adding manual exports is possible but requires maintaining the existing pattern to avoid broken dependencies.

Refer to the [Configuration Reference](configuration.md) for more details on how toggling flags affects these specific structural outputs.
